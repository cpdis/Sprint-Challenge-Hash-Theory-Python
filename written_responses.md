1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

A regular expression is a way to define a search pattern using a sequence of characters. The sequence of characters is used to find or find and replace text in a document. The developer defines the search pattern using a specific set of characters (|, ?, \*, +, /, [], {}, (), among others) and then combines that with a languages built in functions for searching through a document to return only results that match (or don't match) the regular expression.

2. What is an array and how does it work?

An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements that are usually of the same data type (integer, string, etc.). An array works by storing values at index positions that can be reliably computed at any point in time.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

A hash table is simply an array with its elements indexed by a hashed key. It works by taking a key (a first and last name, for example), computing its hash using a hash function, then using that hashed value as the index for the array.
